Robotics and Perception Group is led by Prof. Davide Scaramuzza. 
Our lab was founded in February 2012 and is part of the Department of Informatics, 
at the University of Zurich, and the Department of Neuroinformatics, 
which is a joint institute of both the University of Zurich and ETH Zurich.
Our mission is to research the fundamental challenges of robotics and computer 
vision that will benefit all of humanity. Our key interest is to develop autonomous machines 
that can navigate all by themselves using only onboard cameras and computation, 
without relying on external infrastructure, such as GPS or position tracking systems, 
nor off-board computing. Our interests encompass predonimantly micro drones because 
they are more challenging and offer more research opportunities than ground robots.
